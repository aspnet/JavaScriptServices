# The templates can't contain their own .gitignore files, because Yeoman has strange default handling for
# files with that name (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1862). So, each template instead has a template_gitignore
# file which gets renamed after the files are copied. And so any files that need to be excluded in the source
# repo have to be excluded here.
